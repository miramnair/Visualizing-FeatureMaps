Visualizing Feature maps generated by Convolutional and max pooling layers in a CNN


In my final year, I implemented a project in a Neural network using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. I finished the project and even managed a decent score, but after it was over, I took some time to reflect on whether I understood every step I implemented in my CNN model. I found myself in a "yes and no" situation. I clearly understood what was happening in each layer, but I found it challenging to visualize the intricate details in my head. So, I chose to dive deeper into this topic and gain a better understanding by visualizing individual layers' outputs within a CNN.

Here's the scoop: Matrix multiplications make me lightheaded as a helium balloon at a birthday party. So, before I set off on this adventure, I made a rock-solid decision to put my focus on visual representations and sweep the math stuff under the rug. I have documented the step-by-step process of what I did and the articles I referred to, so there will be no surprises.
